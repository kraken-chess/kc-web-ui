# KRAKEN CHESS WEBSITE

## Overview

Manages the [kraken-chess project](https://github.com/kraken-chess) website UI (assets, source code, hosting configurations).

AWS Infrastructure-as-code done using the Typescript library and CLI [AWS Cloud Development Kit (CDK)](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cdk/latest/guide/home.html), which saves many lines of raw boilerplate CloudFormation YAML or JSON.

+ You can think of CloudFormation templates as Assembly language, and CDK constructs as your favorite high level programming language

## CDK Infrastructure-as-Code

### "Yes I know how CloudFormation and CDK work"

Go to the [`Setup ad Getting Started`](SETUP.md) section.

### "I know how CloudFormation works (or a similar Infrastructure-as-Configuration product), but not CDK"

You've done the hard part. Now just go over:

+ [CDK Basic Concepts](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cdk/latest/guide/core_concepts.html)
+ [Getting started with CDK](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cdk/latest/guide/getting_started.html)
+ [Quick example to test your understanding](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cdk/latest/guide/serverless_example.html)

From there you can proceed to [`Setup and Getting Started`](SETUP.md).

### "I don't know how either CloudFormation or CDK work, but have used AWS"

I'd recommend the basics of CloudFormation, followed by everything in the above case:

+ [CloudFormation Basic Concepts](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSCloudFormation/latest/UserGuide/cfn-whatis-concepts.html) and [Basic Workflow](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSCloudFormation/latest/UserGuide/cfn-whatis-howdoesitwork.html)
+ The ENTIRE [Getting Started with CloudFormation](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSCloudFormation/latest/UserGuide/GettingStarted.html) section
+ Run through some [examples using the AWS CLI](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSCloudFormation/latest/UserGuide/cfn-using-cli.html)

  + I advise against using the [CloudFormation Designer](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSCloudFormation/latest/UserGuide/working-with-templates-cfn-designer.html) purely for the reason that knowing the underlying YAML/JSON promotes more understanding than a drag-and-drop UI

### "I don't have time to read - just tell me how to make changes"
