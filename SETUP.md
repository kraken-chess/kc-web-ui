# SETUP AND GETTING STARTED

Clone the package, and skim the [Getting Started section on CDK docs](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cdk/latest/guide/getting_started.html).

# 0. Warnings

+ **DO NOT** expose either your own or the main kraken-chess AWS account/credentials accidentally in a commit
+ **DO NOT** Use the main kraken-chess AWS account for testing (you are to use your **own** account, and are responsible for any resource cleanup after you are done)

# 1. Install Dependencies

This project uses Typescript, so we will install the associated dependencies.

## Node.js >= 10.3.0

Install using [this guide based on operating sytem](https://nodejs.org/en/download/package-manager/). Node Package Manager (npm) comes installed with this as well.

Make sure you have the latest version of ```npm```, ```n```, and ```nodejs```.

```bash
$ npm cache clean -f
$ npm install -g n
$ n stable
```

## TypeScript >= 2.7:

See [TypeScript wiki](https://www.typescriptlang.org/download). However you should probably just install via npm: ```npm install typescript --save-dev```

## Install AWS CDK, and update the typescript framework

```bash
$ npm install -g aws-cdk
$ cdk --version
# run if complaints about language framework out of date
$ npx npm-check-updates -u
```

# 2. Initial AWS Setup

## [Create a personal AWS Account](https://portal.aws.amazon.com/billing/signup#/start)

Also note down the following info somewhere secure:

+ AWS account id (ex. 123456789012)
+ ```aws__access_key_id```
+ ```aws_secret_access_key```

## (Optional) [Install AWS CLI](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/userguide/install-cliv2.html)

# 3. CDK Setup

## Setup AWS Configuration for CDK Usage

In order to use the CDK CLI in this project, you must provide:

1. AWS credentials and region (acces key, secret key, region: ex. us-west-2)
2. AWS account ID (12-digit account ID shown on AWS Console)

### AWS Credentials and Deployment Region

In any case, first create a ```.env``` file in the following path: ```/path/to/project/root/.env```.

As noted in the [Specifying Credentials CDK documentation](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cdk/latest/guide/getting_started.html#getting_started_credentials), you have two options:

1. Create a named configuration profile
2. Specify environment variables

#### Option 1: Named Configuration Profile

Follow the above documentation to set this up for your specific operating system.
You can use the [AWS CLI credentials documentation](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/userguide/cli-configure-files.html) to aid you futher. For example, your ```~/.aws/config``` (```%USERPROFILE%\.aws\config``` on Windows) could look like:

```bash
[kraken-chess]
aws_access_key_id=<your_access_key>
aws_secret_access_key=<your_secret_access_key>
region=<your_region>
````

The CDK usage using this method will be as follows for all cases:

```bash
$ cdk --profile [profile_name] [CDK_COMMANDS] ...
```

 The ```--profile``` option is useful if you already have other AWS CLI configurations, and want to leave no ambiguity as to which set of credentials you are using for this project.
 If you prefer not having to enter ```--profile``` each time, you can perform the setup using ```[default]``` profile, which the CDK CLI will default to everytime the CLI is invoked.

#### Option 2: Environment Variables

This project takes advantage of environment variables using the [npm dotenv dependency](https://www.npmjs.com/package/dotenv).
On startup, the pipeline definition will look for ```/path/to/project/root/.env``` for environment
variables, and will set them for the instance that the program is run.

```bash
AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID=<your_access_key>
AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY=<you_secret_access_key>

CDK_DEFAULT_REGION=<your_region>
```

The ```CDK_DEFAULT_REGION``` must be named as such, as it is the environment which is used by CDK in the AWS CodeBuild host to evaluate region.

This option carries more risk, however. Though the ```.env``` file is ignored by version control, it is possible for someone to easily change that, making it that much easier to accidentally commit your confidential credentials. For that reason, you should be careful if you choose this option.

### AWS Account ID

This project already uses [npm dotenv dependency](https://www.npmjs.com/package/dotenv), so you should include the following in ```/path/to/project/root/.env```:

```bash
CDK_DEFAULT_ACCOUNT=012345678912
```

The ```CDK_DEFAULT_ACCOUNT``` must be named as such, as it is the environment which is used by CDK in the AWS CodeBuild host to evaluate account ID.

Test this out by running: ```$ aws --profile kraken-chess s3 ls``` (command should not give access exceptions). At this point you can start developing, and should consult DEVELOPMENT .md

# 4. Test the Setup

## AWS Credentials recognized

```bash
$ aws --profile <your_profile> s3 mb s3://cdk-test-bucket-<your-name-in-lower-case>
$ aws --profile <your_profile> s3 rb s3://cdk-test-bucket-<your-name-in-lower-case>
# OR if you configured with environment variables...
$ aws s3 mb s3://cdk-test-bucket-<your-name-in-lower-case>
$ aws s3 rb s3://cdk-test-bucket-<your-name-in-lower-case>
```

### AWS Account ID and Region recongnized

```bash
# For Windows...
$ npm run win-clean
# For Linux/macOS...
$ npm run nix-clean
# ... and then for both
$ npm install
$ npm run build
# If using profile configs
$ cdk --profile <your_profile> synth
# OR if using environment variables...
$ cdk synth
```

After running the final command, you should see something like the following:

```
CDK Environment configurations: Account=<your_account_id>, Region=<your_region>
...
<CloudFormation YAML configuration>
```

You should see no errors.
